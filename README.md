# 10 Print Box üì∫

A simple implementation of the [10 print algorithm](https://10print.org) on Arduino, with native TV output.
A potentiometer adjusts the probability threshold, allowing you to change the patterns which are generated!

## Hardware ‚öô

This 10 Print runs on an Arduino Uno, although the code will run on most of the Arduino range. The compatibility is dependent on the platforms supported by the [TVOut library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/TVout).

To build the box, you'll need:
- An Arduino
- A linear potentiometer (mine was 100k, but 10k should also be fine)
- A female RCA jack (or a male one if you don't want to plug a cable between the box and the TV)
- The two 3D printed box parts (STL files are included in this repository)
- Either:
  - One 470 Ohm resistor and one 1K Ohm resistor
  - Three 1K Ohm resistors (this is what I used as I had them to hand)

If you don't know how to upload code to an Arduino, have a look [here.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Howto).

Before you upload the code to the Arduino, be sure to check that the code has the correct video output for your TV. If you're in a PAL region, you can use the code as provided. If you're in an NTSC region, you'll need to change one line (don't worry, it's easy and labelled!). If you don't know which region you're in, see the [useful graphic on this page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL)

If you're using a 470 Ohm resistor, replace the two 1K ohm resistors in parallel with this.

The resistors that come from pin 7 and 9 of the Arduino connect together, and then connect to the centre pin of the RCA jack (this isn't obvious in the Fritzing diagram, sorry!). The sleeve of the RCA jack connects to one of the GND pins on the Arduino.

If you're using the 3D printed box, I'd recommend holding everything together with a few blobs of hot glue, or something similar. Make sure you test it's working before you hot glue it!
